> A Smarter way to understand your blood.

## What is it?
MEDiNTEL is a API that share your blood with your doctor in a different way.
MEDiNTEL collects data from your blood count and shares with your doctor; Your doctor can analyze your blood in a different way too.

## Why did it arise?
Because of the problems arising from doctor-patient communication that are often lacking: *Time, agility and clarity*

MEDiNTEL has emerged.

## Proposal
MEDiNTEL offers some solutions to the problems already mentioned:

+ Faster
+ More Agile
+ More Communicative
+ All the time with you

## And how does it work?
*Simple!*
With the entire Database and Useful Information on the Patient's Blood Count we can analyze, share and do the magic. Making sure that when the patient's doctor inserts the blood count into the system, everything works autonomously and almost instantly, thus generating for both doctor and patient, the exam formatted on a simple way that both can understand (Or in case you use the API: json response ;)). Then a copy is saved in the database allowing the patient and the pacient's doctor to see it later.

## Technologies used
For the API:
+ *NodeJS*
+ *MySQL*

For the Frontend (Representational Only): *ReactJS*

Besides the mainly techs, there are:<br/>
+ *Sequelize (ORM)* <br/>
+ *Auth JWT* <br/>
+ *Axios* <br/>

## Observations
Contains Bugs (On Frontend)

## Version
> **1.0.0**
